This project in all its glory represents the best framework for working with the backend - NestJS in conjunction with Docker, a bunch of useful libraries.
The project is developing and will soon have its own front written in React for better UX.

Description of the project structure, main components and their work:

1. Folder structure:

- users-service - user service generated by faker (for other services).
- products-service - product service generated by faker (for other services).
- orders-service - order service with customer reviews to increase profitability.
- chat-service - allows you to get the name and information about the product in the entire database by keyword.
